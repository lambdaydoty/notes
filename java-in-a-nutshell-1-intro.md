- The Big Three
  1. The Language
  2. The JVM
  3. The Ecosystem
- The Abbre.
  * Java ME: *Mobile Edition* (for embedded devices)
  * Java SE: *Standard Edition*
  * Java EE: *Enterprise Edition* (...)
- Basic Features
  * Class based, object oriented
  * C-like syntax
  * Smalltalk-like runtime features
  * Easy to read/write, and sometimes verbose
  * Industry experience from C++ without the complex features
  * Conservative design, slow rate of change
  * 8 is the most radical change since 1996
  * 9 with modules system (JPMS)
  * Source -> Byte code -> JVM runtime (JVM = an interpreter for the bytecode)
- JVM Features
  * Comprises a *container* **for app code to run inside
  * Provide a secure and reliable exec env as compared to C/C++
  * Take memory management out of the hands of developers
  * Provide a cross-platform exec env
  * !Make use of runtime info to self-manage! <- seldom mentioned (JIT: Just-in-time compilation)
  * Piggy-back off by other langs: Kotlin, Scala, ...

> One of the main reasons for the success of Java is that this ecosystem is a standarized envirment.
